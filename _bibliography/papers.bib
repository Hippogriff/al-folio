@article{Sharma2019,
abstract = { User generated 3D shapes in online repositories contain rich
                  information about surfaces, primitives, and their geometric
                  relations, often arranged in a hierarchy. We present a
                  framework for learning representations of 3D shapes that
                  reflect the information present in this meta data and show
                  that it leads to improved generalization for semantic
                  segmentation tasks. Our approach is a point embedding network
                  that generates a vectorial representation of the 3D points
                  such that it reflects the grouping hierarchy and tag data. The
                  main challenge is that the data is noisy and highly variable.
                  To this end, we present a tree-aware metric-learning approach
                  and demonstrate that such learned embeddings offer excellent
                  transfer to semantic segmentation tasks, especially when
                  training data is limited. Our approach reduces the relative
                  error by $10.2\%$ with $8$ training examples, by $11.72\%$
                  with $120$ training examples on the ShapeNet semantic
                  segmentation benchmark, in comparison to the network trained
                  from scratch. By utilizing tag data the relative error is
                  reduced by $12.8\%$ with $8$ training examples, in comparison
                  to the network trained from scratch. These improvements come
                  at no additional labeling cost as the meta data is freely
                  available.},

@article{Sharma2017,
abstract = {We present a neural architecture that takes as input a 2D or 3D shape and outputs a program that generates the shape. The instructions in our program are based on constructive solid geometry principles, i.e., a set of boolean operations on shape primitives defined recursively. Bottom-up techniques for this shape parsing task rely on primitive detection and are inherently slow since the search space over possible primitive combinations is large. In contrast, our model uses a recurrent neural network that parses the input shape in a top-down manner, which is significantly faster and yields a compact and easy-to-interpret sequence of modeling instructions. Our model is also more effective as a shape detector compared to existing state-of-the-art detection techniques. We finally demonstrate that our network can be trained on novel datasets without ground-truth program annotations through policy gradient techniques.},

@inproceedings{Mueller2016,
abstract={The ability to capture stabilized high resolution video from low-cost UAVs has the potential to significantly redefine future objectives in the development of state-of-the-art object tracking methods. In this paper, we propose a persistent, robust and autonomous object tracking system designed for UAV applications, called Persistent Aerial Tracking (PAT) (see Fig. 1). Persistent aerial tracking can serve many purposes, not only related to surveillance but also search and rescue, wild-life monitoring, crowd monitoring/management, and extreme sports. Deploying PAT on UAVs is a very promising application, since the camera can follow the target based on its visual feedback and actively change its orientation and position to optimize for tracking performance (e.g. persistent tracking accuracy in the presence of occlusion or fast motion across large and diverse areas). This is the defining difference with static tracking systems, which passively analyze a dynamic scene to produce analytics for other systems. It enables ad-hoc and low-cost surveillance that can be quickly deployed, especially in locales where surveillance infrastructure is not already established or feasible (e.g. remote locations, rugged terrain, and large water bodies.},
